Welcome to the **50 Days DSA Challenge** repository! This project is designed to help you strengthen your Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) skills through a series of daily challenges over the course of 50 days. Whether you're preparing for technical interviews, enhancing your problem-solving skills, or just looking to master DSA concepts, this challenge is perfect for you!

## About the Challenge

Each day, you'll find a new problem or a set of problems focusing on different aspects of DSA, ranging from basic to advanced levels. The problems are carefully curated to cover a wide array of topics, including but not limited to:

- Arrays and Strings
- Linked Lists
- Stacks and Queues
- Trees and Graphs
- Sorting and Searching Algorithms
- Dynamic Programming
- Recursion
- Hashing
- Bit Manipulation

## How to Participate

1. **Fork this repository** to your GitHub account.
2. **Clone the forked repository** to your local machine.
3. **Navigate to the challenge folder** for the current day.
4. **Read the problem statement** and attempt to solve it.
5. **Submit your solution** by creating a new branch and making a pull request.

## Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

```
50-Days-DSA-Challenge/
â”œâ”€â”€ Day 01/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Problem.md
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Solution.java (or Solution.py, etc.)
â”œâ”€â”€ Day 02/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Problem.md
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Solution.java (or Solution.py, etc.)
...
â”œâ”€â”€ Day 50/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Problem.md
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Solution.java (or Solution.py, etc.)
```

- Each day's folder contains a `Problem.md` file with the problem statement and a `Solution` file in the programming language of your choice.
- You are encouraged to add comments and explanations in your solution to help others understand your approach.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions! If you have a new problem or an improvement to an existing solution, feel free to make a pull request. Please ensure your contributions are well-documented and tested.
